    <h3>
        Game Rules
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            No check. Simply capture the enemy king to win.
            The game continues as long as a player has at least 1 king and can make a move.
        </li>
        <li>
            Different gamemodes (particularly 1D chess) may have different rules for piece movement. Clicking on a piece
            will highlight its legal moves.

    </ul>

        </li>
